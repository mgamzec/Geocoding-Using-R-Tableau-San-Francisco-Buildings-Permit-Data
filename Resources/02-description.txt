* In many cases we have access to data with location information e.g. Address, City ,County ,Zip Code , Country. To visualize this data with more detail we need to use geolocation.
* In order get the actual geolocation coordinates (Longitute,Latitude) for the location data, we need to calculate this coordenates.
* Using nominatim a free search engine for OpenStreetMap data to easily find out geolocation coordinates.

**OpenStreetMap:** Is open data built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, trails, caf√©s, railway stations, and much more, all over the world.

### Load Packages in R/RStudio 

We are going to use tidyverse a collection of R packages designed for data science. As well as other packages to help with data cleaning and processing. 

* tidiverse: https://www.tidyverse.org/
* rvest: https://github.com/tidyverse/rvest
* stringi: https://github.com/gagolews/stringi
* jsonlite: https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite


*The chunk below checks that all the necessary packages are installed in the computer*

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

options(scipen = 9999)

# Here we are checking if the package is installed
if(!require("tidyverse")){
  # If the package is not in the system then it will be install
  install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
  # Here we are loading the package
  library("tidyverse")
}

# Here we are checking if the package is installed
if(!require("rvest")){
  # If the package is not in the system then it will be install
  install.packages("rvest", dependencies = TRUE)
  # Here we are loading the package
  library("rvest")
}

# Here we are checking if the package is installed
if(!require("stringi")){
  # If the package is not in the system then it will be install
  install.packages("stringi", dependencies = TRUE)
  # Here we are loading the package
  library("stringi")
}

# Here we are checking if the package is installed
if(!require("lubridate")){
  # If the package is not in the system then it will be install
  install.packages("lubridate", dependencies = TRUE)
  # Here we are loading the package
  library("lubridate")
}


# Here we are checking if the package is installed
if(!require("jsonlite")){
  # If the package is not in the system then it will be install
  install.packages("jsonlite", dependencies = TRUE)
  # Here we are loading the package
  library("jsonlite")
}
